# Compiling from source code
 This guide assumes you already have the basic libraries for compiling a Haxe/OpenFL/HaxeFlixel application

## HTML5
 HTML5 as a target has not been tested and is generally not recommended.
## Windows and Linux
 No extra setup is required for windows builds, as the project was made on windows.
 Same goes for linux targets.
## Android
 TO-DO, Update this guide, until then, Lime and HXCPP have been updated to support Android builds better, you can use the official guide on the Lime docs.
